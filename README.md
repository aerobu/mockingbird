CS230 Project Mockingbird

Preparation -
1. Download the original Gutenburg Poetry Corpus from https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-poetry-corpus
2. Extract the ndjson file containing the corpus
3. Run the data preparation Jupyter notebook (set correct paths) - iteration_1_dataset_prep.ipynb
4. This produces the training data we will use - tonekized_poetry_subset.json
5. Save this in the correct folder as needed for the fine-tuning stage shown in github_mockingbird_iteration_1.ipynb
6. Run the notebook to produce the required finetuned model output
7. Save the finetuned model and generate the sample output
8. Note: My finetuned model is not saved here due to size restrictions
